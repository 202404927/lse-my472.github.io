### Course Description

This course will cover the principles of digital methods for storing and structuring data,
including data types, relational and non­relational database design, and query languages.
Students will learn to build, populate, manipulate and query databases based on datasets
relevant to their fields of interest. The course will also cover workflow management
for typical data transformation and cleaning projects, frequently the starting point
and most time­-consuming part of any data science project.  This course uses a
project-based learning approach towards the study of performance computation and
group­-based collaboration, essential ingredients of modern data science projects.
The coverage of data sharing will include key skills in on-line publishing, including
the elements of web design, the technical elements of web technologies and web programming,
as well as the use of revision-control and group collaboration tools such as GitHub.

### Objectives

In this course, we introduce principles and applications of the electronic
storage, structuring, manipulation, transformation, extraction, and
dissemination of data. This includes data types, database design,
data base implementation, and data analysis through structured queries.
Through joining operations, we will also cover the challenges of data
linkage and how to combine datasets from different sources. We begin
by discussing concepts in fundamental data types, and how data is stored
and recorded electronically.

Cloud computing and online collaboration tools forms the second part of this
course, along with the tools and technologies that underlie them. Students will
firstly learn the basics of cloud computing that can serve various purposes such
as secure hosting of webpages and web services and on-demand computations for
data analysis and then learn how to set up a cloud-computing environment through
Amazon Web Services, a popular cloud platform.  Collaboration and the
dissemination and submission of course assignments will use GitHub, the popular
code repository and version control system. The course also provides in­depth
look at various common data-types on the Internet such as various mark­up languages
(e.g. HTML and XML) and JSON.  Students also study the fundamentals of
acquisition and management of the data from the Internet through both scraping of
websites and accessing APIs of online databases and social network services.

In the third part of the course, we will learn the data management and basic
methodology of data analysis. We will cover database design, especially
relational databases, using substantive examples across a variety of fields.
Students are introduced to SQL through MySQL, and programming assignments in
this unit of the course will be designed to insure that students learn to
create, populate and query an SQL database. We will introduce NoSQL using
MongoDB and the JSON data format for comparison. For both types of database,
students will be encouraged to work with data relevant to their own interests as
they learn to create, populate and query data. In the next section of the data
section of the course, we will step through a complete workflow including data
cleaning and transformation, illustrating many of the practical challenges faced
at the outset of any data analysis or data science project. The course will be
concluded with the discussion of performance issues in computation with the
particular focus on parallel computing.


### Assessment

#### Formative coursework

Students will be expected to produce five weekly, structured problem sets with a
beginning component to be started in the staff-led lab sessions, to be
completed by the student outside of class. Answers should be formatted and
submitted for assessment. One or more of these problem sets will be completed
in collaboration with other students.

#### Summative Assignments

Take home exam (50%) and in class assessment (50%).

Student problem sets will be marked and will provide 50% of the mark.
