### Course Description

This course will cover the principles of digital methods for storing and structuring data, 
including data types, relational and non­relational database design, and query languages. 
Students will learn to build, populate, manipulate and query databases based on datasets 
relevant to their fields of interest. The course will also cover workflow management 
for typical data transformation and cleaning projects, frequently the starting point 
and most time­-consuming part of any data science project.  This course uses a 
project-based learning approach towards the study of online publishing and 
group­-based collaboration, essential ingredients of modern data science projects. 
The coverage of data sharing will include key skills in on-line publishing, including 
the elements of web design, the technical elements of web technologies and web programming, 
as well as the use of revision-control and group collaboration tools such as GitHub. 
Each student will build one or more interactive website based on content relevant to 
his/her domain­-related interests, and will use GitHub for accessing and submitting 
course materials and assignments.

### Objectives

In this course, we introduce principles and applications of the electronic 
storage, structuring, manipulation, transformation, extraction, and 
dissemination of data. This includes data types, database design, 
data base implementation, and data analysis through structured queries. 
Through joining operations, we will also cover the challenges of data 
linkage and how to combine datasets from different sources. We begin 
by discussing concepts in fundamental data types, and how data is stored 
and recorded electronically. We will cover database design, especially 
relational databases, using substantive examples across a variety of fields. 
Students are introduced to SQL through MySQL, and programming assignments 
in this unit of the course will be designed to insure that students learn to 
create, populate and query an SQL database. We will introduce NoSQL using 
MongoDB and the JSON data format for comparison. For both types of database, 
students will be encouraged to work with data relevant to their own interests 
as they learn to create, populate and query data. In the final section of the 
data section of the course, we will step through a complete workflow including 
data cleaning and transformation, illustrating many of the practical challenges 
faced at the outset of any data analysis or data science project.

Online publishing and collaboration tools forms the second part of this course, 
along with the tools and technologies that underlie them. Students will develop 
interactive, secure and powerful projects for the World Wide Web using both client
 and server side technologies. Collaboration and the dissemination and submission 
 of course assignments will use GitHub, the popular code repository and version 
 control system. The course begins with an in­depth look at the mark­up languages 
 that form the foundations of building web sites with a study of HTML and CSS. 
 Students next study basic programming in JavaScript, to provide client and 
 server side tools including the customization of web content using Bootstrap 
 and Jekyll to publish web pages, which will provide the basis for a class project.

### Assessment

#### Formative coursework

Students will be expected to produce five weekly, structured problem sets with a 
beginning component to be started in the staff-led lab sessions, to be 
completed by the student outside of class. Answers should be formatted and 
submitted for assessment. 

#### Summative Assignments

Take home exam (50%) and in class assessment (50%).

Student problem sets will be marked and will provide 50% of the mark.
